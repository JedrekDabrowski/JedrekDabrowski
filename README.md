<strong>WeatherApp</strong>
<br/>
The Weather App is my first React Project, app allows you to find inormation about current weather around the world.
<br/>

All data were fetched from: https://openweathermap.org/
<br/>

<strong>Millionaires</strong>
<br/>
Millionaires App is a well-known game which we all know from TV.
