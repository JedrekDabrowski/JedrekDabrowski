### Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

I am studying IT at Bialystok University of Technology.
<br/>
I focus on learning Front-end technologies like HTML,CSS/SASS and JavaScript/React. 
<br/>
I love doing my own procjects because in my opinion it's the best way to develop.

### My Projects
<strong>WeatherApp</strong>
<br/>
The Weather App is my first React Project, app allows you to find inormation about current weather around the world.
<br/>
In the first version I used class components then I refactor them to funcional components.
<br/>
All data were fetched from: https://openweathermap.org/
<br/>
<br/>
You can see how it works here:

<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Millionaires</strong>
<br/>
Millionaires App is a well-known game which we all know from TV.
<br/>
In the first version I used class component then I refactor them to funcional components. I want to pratice more React Context so I add GameContext Component to avoid "props drilling" approach. 
<br/>
All data were fetched from: https://opentdb.com/
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you luck because the questions are tough. Have fun!
