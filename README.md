### Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

I am studying IT at Bialystok University of Technology.
<br/>
I focus on learning Front-end technologies like HTML,CSS/SASS and JavaScript/React. 
<br/>
I love doing my own procjects because in my opinion it's the best way to develop!

 The Weather App is my first React Project, app allows you to find inormation about current weather around the world.

 In the first version I used class components so now I need to refactor them to funcional components.
<br/>
<br/>

 Millionaires App is a well-known game which we all know from TV.
 <br/>
