### Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

Experienced React Native developer with a passion for mobile app development. Recognised for strong problem-solving skills and an ability to quickly learn new technologies. I consider myself to be well organised and highly motivated.

As a React Native developer, I enjoy supporting open-source projects that drive the growth of the community. I actively take part in discussions, sharing my knowledge and experience, which helps me support others while also learning new things. Additionally, I am part of React Native Warsaw conferences team, bringing developers together to exchange ideas and grow together.
